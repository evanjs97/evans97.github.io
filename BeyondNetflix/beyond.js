            <p>First off this list will not be a review of any movie but rather, a list of 10 of my favorite movies which I believe
              are undervalued. Some of these movies have received critical acclaim, and some haven't. What they share in
              common is that they are rarely seen near the top of best movie lists, but deserve to be seen nonetheless.
              These movies are great but often overlooked. For each movie I will give a short synopsis and list a few of
              the movies merits. The list will be ordered, both by comparing how great the movie is, to how well known
              it is. However, all these movies are well worth watching, so I suggest you do if you haven't already.
              Now, here's the list!</p>

            <p></p>
            <h5>#10: Argo</h5>
            <p>Released in 2012 to huge critical praise, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argo" target="_blank">Argo</a> is
              probably the most well-known movie on this list, which
              is also why its not higher up in my rankings. This historical drama adapted from multiple accounts of
              the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Caper" target="_blank">"Canadian Caper"</a>, a joint
              CIA and Canadian Government rescue operation of 6 American diplomats.
              Although you may have already seen this title, it is a must watch if you haven't.</p>

            <p></p>
            <h5>#9: Tucker and Dale vs. Evil</h5>
            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_%26_Dale_vs._Evil" target="_blank">Tucker and Dale vs. Evil</a> is a
              comedy horror film following two average hillbillies camping at their cabin.
              The horror starts when they are mistaken for killers by a group of college students. Tucker and Dale is a
              very enjoyable horror movie and is even streaming on Netflix right now. That being said, Tucker and Dale
              is not necessarily a movie for everyone However if your a fan of horror movies, and especially for fans
              of A Cabin in the Woods, this movie is for you.</p>
            <img src="../Images/10list/catch_me_if_you_can.jpg" className="img-fluid text-center"></img>
            <p></p>
            <h5>#8 Catch Me if You Can</h5>
            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch_Me_If_You_Can" target="_blank">Catch Me if You Can</a> has all
              the big names, directed by Steven Spielberg and
              starring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_DiCaprio" target="_blank">Leonardo Dicaprio</a> among
              others. The film was released in 2002 and is a biographical film following the life of Frank
              Abagnale, a criminal whose primary crime was check fraud. If you haven’t given it a watch already, I highly
              suggest you do.</p>
            <img src="../Images/10list/nightcrawler.jpg" className="img-fluid text-center"></img>
            <p></p>
            <h5>#7 Nightcrawler</h5>
            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightcrawler_(film)" target="_blank">Nightcrawler</a> is a
              thriller following Jake Gyllenhaal as Louis Bloom. Bloom is a "stringer", a freelance photographer who records
              violent events in the night and sells them to local news station. The movie was nominated for best
              original screenplay in 2014 and is certainly worth the watch.</p>
            <img src="../Images/10list/drive.jpg" className="img-fluid text-center"></img>
            <p></p>
            <h5>#6: Drive</h5>
            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive_(2011_film)" target="_blank">Drive</a> is yet another
              crime thriller on this list, and is quite similar in style to the previous movie, Nightcrawler.
              Starring Ryan Gosling, drive follows his harrowing
              nights as a getaway driver for all sorts of criminals. The film was released in 2011 and received lots
              of critical appraise. Drive is a must watch for fans of the thriller genre.</p>
            <img src="../Images/10list/battle_royale.jpg" className="img-fluid text-center"></img>
            <p></p>
            <h5>#5: Battle Royale</h5>
            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Royale_(film)" target="_blank">This</a> Japanese film is
              essentially the hunger games, before the hunger games existed. Sadly it did not
              receive nearly as much attention as the latter series did despite its similarities. It is quite possible
              the hunger games was based off this movie. If you are a fan of the hunger games or just want to see a
              great foreign language film, this movie is for you.</p>
            <img src="../Images/10list/along_came_a_spider.jpg" className="img-fluid text-center"></img>
            <p></p>
            <h5>#4: Along Came a Spider</h5>
            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Royale_(film)" target="_blank">Along Came A Spider</a> is a
              psychological horror movie based off the second book from
              the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Cross_(novel_series)" target="_blank">Alex Cross Series</a>. The
              story follows a detective (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Freeman" target="_blank">Morgan Freeman</a>)
              as he uncovers clues surrounding the kidnapping of the president’s daughter. Along Came a Spider is worth
              the watch regardless of whether you’ve read the book or not.</p>
            <img src="../Images/10list/man_from_uncle.jpg" className="img-fluid text-center"></img>
            <p></p>
            <h5>#3: The Man From U.N.C.L.E</h5>
            <p>Although <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_from_U.N.C.L.E._(film)" target="_blank">The Man from U.N.C.L.E</a> did
              not receive great critical reviews, it is an extremely entertaining
              action, spy, comedy. Set during the cold war, the story follows a CIA and KGB agent who must work
              together to stop an international criminal organization. Great spy movies are hard to come by, but
              the Man from Uncle is one of the best.</p>
            <img src="../Images/10list/memento.jpg" className="img-fluid text-center"></img>
            <p></p>
            <h5>#2: Memento</h5>
            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_(film)" target="_blank">Memento</a> is a thriller movie released in 2000 (Yes I know I like thrillers). The story revolves around
              a man who is unable to form new memories, suffering short term memory loss every few minutes. He uses
              photographs and tattoos to track information as he tracks his wife's killer. Memento is a complex
              masterpiece and it will take many viewings to fully understand everything that is going on in its plot.</p>
            <img src="../Images/10list/wild_tales.jpg" className="img-fluid text-center"></img>
            <p></p>
            <h5>#1: Wild tales</h5>
            <p>This Argentine-Spanish film is one of the most unique movies on this
              list. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Tales_(film)" target="_blank">Wild Tales</a> is a black comedy
              consisting of six short stories. The stories are all quite different and could easily stand on their
              own. If you are thinking this sounds like black mirror, then yes you are correct, this is certainly a
              black mirror-esque movie. Wild tales plays on similar themes as black mirror such as violence and
              vengeance. If you are a fan of black mirror this is the movie for you. Wild Tales is smart, funny
              and very well put together.</p>
